Tell me about HCI's history.,"Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) is Singapore's independent school with a rich history of over 100 years.  The Institution is the culmination of the watershed merger in 2005 between the former Chinese High School (TCHS) and Hwa Chong Junior College (HCJC). The then Chinese High School (TCHS) was founded by Mr Tan Kah Kee in 1919 to cater to the needs of primary school leavers of the Chinese community in the region. It became the first Chinese-language secondary school in South-east Asia. Entering Singaporeâ€™s post-independence era, TCHS was designated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) as one of nine Special Assistance Plan (SAP) Schools in the nation in 1979, before turning independent in 1987."
